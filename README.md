🚀 QuickStart your DAO Community Journey 📈

1. Join and talk to us in our platforms.

[\\]: # "We are in Workplace WorkChat and our Matrix Network, follow instructions [here]()."

2. Spend some time absorbing the culture and reading the documentations before you start contributing.

3. Understand our [governance](https://github.com/DAO-Community/.github/tree/main/GOVERNANCE.md). In every community there are rules to follow, read these and make your experience without conflict to the community.

4. Start small. No need to rush, contribute by submitting minor issues and pull requests. There will be mistakes, but small contributions are still progress leading to your more significant contributions in the future!

Note that when you first join, you will not have direct write permissions on the projects because we are not sure whether your submission complies with the project specifications.

You can fork any project of interest to your personal GitHub account, make changes to the project, and submit your PR.

SIG's project maintainers reviews your submissions. Maybe your initial submission is not standardized, and that’s okay.

Try submitting more often, and you will gradually become familiar with GitHub’s various interactive operations and form a standard.

For some big tech companies, associates may take about a dozen revisions before their PR gets approved, so don't worry you're fine.

When your submissions are consistent with the project's specifications, the SIG's project maintainers will add you to the Collaborators list of the corresponding project to jointly maintain the project.

If you are not familiar with the GitHub operation process, you can refer to this article.
