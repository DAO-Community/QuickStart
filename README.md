**📄 File under 🏗 construction.**

Note that when you first join, you will not have direct write permissions on the projects because we are not sure whether your submission complies with the project specifications.

You can fork any project of interest to your personal GitHub account, make changes to the project, and submit your PR.

SIG's project maintainers reviews your submissions. Maybe your initial submission is not standardized, and that’s okay.

Try submitting more often, and you will gradually become familiar with GitHub’s various interactive operations and form a standard.

For some big tech companies, associates may take about a dozen revisions before their PR gets approved, so don't worry you're fine.

When your submissions are consistent with the project's specifications, the SIG's project maintainers will add you to the Collaborators list of the corresponding project to jointly maintain the project.

If you are not familiar with the GitHub operation process, you can refer to this article.
